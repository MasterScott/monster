A RaspberryPi based Halloween prop that is guaranteed to scare the costumes off Trick or Treaters and make your house the favorite haunt of the neighborhood

This fully open-source project creates a "Monster in a Box" Halloween prop, a fully animated box that appears to be jailing a monster which is on the verge of escaping.

In order to replicate the MVP (v0.0.1) you will need to have prior experience with RaspberryPi, Python, 3d Printing, and some basic electronic component knowledge. However I am expecting to continue with this project and release a more complete project for the general public by Halloween 2019.


## Parts List:

* RaspberryPi 3 B+       : https://www.amazon.com/RS-Components-Raspberry-Pi-Motherboard/dp/B07BFH96M3/             (34.99)
* 32Gb SD Card           : https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-MicroSD-Adapter-MB-ME32GA-AM/dp/B06XWN9Q99                (8.99)
* 2 Chan 5V Relay Module : https://www.amazon.com/SunFounder-Channel-Optocoupler-Expansion-Raspberry/dp/B00E0NTPP4/ (6.79)


## Release History

* 0.0.1
    * MVP -- 2018 Halloween. RaspberryPi based, because that is what I have on hand.
